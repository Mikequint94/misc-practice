# Public / Private / Protected Methods

## Public:  can call whenever. Defaults

## Private:
## method can only be called within a class where it was defined.
## Like from another method within the class.

## Protected:
## same.  Only used internally within object.
## can do self.method_name and it will work.  or call that method on other instances
## of the same class.

# Object Oriented Programming
## Programming Paradigm based on the concept of objects.
## class based, objects are instances of classes.  Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

# What is a load balancer?
## Distributing incoming network traffic across multiple backend servers.
## Efficiently reroutes traffic only to servers that are online and aren't overworked.
## Could distribute round robin, or by least connections, or by hashing IP address.

# How do shards work?
## Sharding is database partitioning to separate large databases into smaller faster shards.
## Data is not repeated across shards and spread across different servers.
## Split maybe based on geographic data or something concrete is easier.
